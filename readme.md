# Welcome to my 30days-of-JS-Challange
-----------------------------------------------

As part of learning JavaScript i have decided to take the 30-days-of-JavaScript  challange by Hasabeneh.
The basic idea is that i engage myself with the every day challange and practices of JS and therefore by the end of the 30 days i could be able to acquire a substantial knowldge in JS.

Alors c'est parti!
